# DiscordBot

</div>
This bot was written mainly for the purpose of completing a college project; its main advantage is the ability to create plugins based on the provided API. If we want to create a fully functional bot, we don't have to worry about creating it from scratch. The bot has built-in database, backup and logger support.


## Features

* Database based on SQLite
* Easy-to-use backup manager
* Integrated Logger class
* Fully asynchronous client
